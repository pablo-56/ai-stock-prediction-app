# **Stock Prediction Web Application**

### **Overview**

This project is a full-stack stock market prediction platform that combines machine learning with modern web development. It allows users to enter a stock ticker symbol and view real-time price predictions displayed in interactive charts, similar to Jupyter Notebook visualizations. The application integrates a machine learning model with a production-ready API and frontend, making advanced financial predictions accessible in a user-friendly way.

### **Problems Addressed**

**For Investors and Users**

* Difficulty predicting stock trends without advanced tools
* Limited access to machine learningâ€“powered insights
* Non-technical barriers when working with raw data and scripts

**For Developers and Businesses**

* Complexity of integrating ML models into real-world applications
* Need for scalable backend services and modern frontend interfaces
* Ensuring performance, security, and data reliability in production

### **Key Features Implemented**

* **Stock Ticker Input**: Users can provide any valid ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA).
* **Machine Learning Model**: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network trained on historical stock data.
* **Data Source**: Automatic retrieval of training data from Yahoo Finance API.
* **Prediction & Visualization**: Forecasted results displayed as interactive charts, similar to Jupyter Notebook plots.
* **REST API**: Django REST Framework provides endpoints for model predictions and data queries.
* **Frontend Interface**: React-based single-page application for smooth user experience.
* **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL database for storing user requests, model outputs, and logs.
